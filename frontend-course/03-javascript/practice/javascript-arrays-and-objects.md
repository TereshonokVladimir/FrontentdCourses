# Practice: Arrays and Objects

## Tasks

### Task 1
Given an array of numbers, use map to double each, filter to keep only evens, and reduce to sum. Chain the methods. Log the result.

### Task 2
Given an array of user objects ({ name, age }), find the first user over 18, get all names as an array, and sort by age descending. Use find, map, and sort. Handle empty array.

### Task 3
Flatten a nested array: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Use flat or reduce. Then group an array of objects by a key (e.g., group users by "role").

### Task 4
Implement a function that deep clones an object (handles nested objects and arrays). Use recursion or JSON.parse(JSON.stringify) for simple cases. Document the limitations (functions, dates, etc.).

### Task 5
Given an array of items with duplicates, remove duplicates. Use Set or filter with indexOf. Then implement a function that merges two objects deeply (nested merge). Handle arrays: replace or merge? Document the behavior.
