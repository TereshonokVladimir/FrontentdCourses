# Practice: Basic Utilities

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a simple card: white background, padding, rounded corners, and shadow. Use flexbox to center content. Add a heading (text-xl, font-bold) and a paragraph (text-gray-600). Add a button with blue background, white text, padding, and rounded. Use only Tailwind classes. No semicolons in any JS/HTML.

### Task 2
Build a navbar: full width, flex, items centered, justify-between, padding. Logo on left (text or placeholder). Nav links on right: Home, About, Contact. Style links with hover (underline or color change). Add a CTA button. Make it sticky (sticky top-0) with a background. Use z-index if needed.

### Task 3
Create a grid of 6 cards. Use CSS Grid: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile. Use gap for spacing. Each card: image placeholder (aspect ratio), title, description, button. Add hover effect: slight lift (translate-y) and shadow increase. Use transition for smooth effect.

### Task 4
Build a form: label, input, and button. Style the input with border, rounded, padding. Add focus ring (focus:ring-2, focus:ring-blue-500). Style the button with hover and active states. Add error state: red border and error message. Use flex or grid for layout. Ensure proper spacing.

### Task 5
Create a responsive layout: sidebar (fixed left, 256px) and main content (flex-1). Sidebar has nav links. Main has a header and content area. On mobile, sidebar becomes a drawer (hidden by default, toggle with button) or stacks. Use md: breakpoint for the switch. Add a hamburger button for mobile. Ensure no horizontal scroll.
