# Practice: Combined Challenge (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Build a marketing page: hero with headline and CTA, features grid (3 items), testimonial, and footer. Use Tailwind for all styling. Ensure responsive (mobile-first). Use consistent spacing and typography. Add hover states. No semicolons.

### Task 2
Add a navbar: sticky, with logo and links. On mobile, hamburger menu. Add a pricing section with 3 tiers. Style the middle tier as featured. Add a contact form (name, email, message) with styled inputs and submit button. Add validation error display. Ensure the form is accessible.

### Task 3
Implement dark mode: add dark: variants to all sections. Add a theme toggle in the navbar. Persist preference. Prevent flash. Add a "Back to top" button that appears on scroll. Style it consistently. Add smooth scroll for anchor links. Ensure focus states throughout.

### Task 4
Create a component library section: showcase Button (3 variants), Card, Badge, Alert. Use your design tokens from config. Add a modal that opens from a button. Style the modal with overlay and animation. Add a dropdown menu. Ensure all components work in light and dark mode. Add loading states (spinner, skeleton).

### Task 5
Polish the full project: marketing page with navbar, hero, features, pricing, testimonial, contact form, footer. Component showcase section. Dark mode with toggle. Responsive design. Animations (hover, focus, modal, dropdown). Custom theme in config. Run Lighthouse (performance, accessibility). Fix any issues. Add a README documenting the Tailwind setup, design tokens, and component usage. Summarize the patterns and best practices used. Ensure the project is production-ready (no console errors, valid HTML, good contrast).
