# Practice: Dashboard UI (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a dashboard layout: sidebar (fixed, 64px or 256px), main content area. Sidebar has nav icons or links (Dashboard, Users, Settings). Main has a header bar with title and user menu placeholder. Use flex. Sidebar dark background, main light. Ensure proper spacing. No semicolons.

### Task 2
Add a stats section: 4 stat cards in a row. Each: label, value, optional trend (up/down). Use grid (4 cols desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile). Style with border or shadow. Use consistent typography. Add a subtle icon or color accent per stat type (e.g., blue for users, green for revenue).

### Task 3
Build a data table: header row with column names, data rows. Use borders or alternating row colors. Add hover state on rows. Make it responsive: on mobile, consider card layout per row or horizontal scroll. Add a search input and filter dropdown above the table. Style inputs consistently.

### Task 4
Add a chart placeholder: a div with fixed height, gradient or pattern to simulate a chart. Add a header with title and date range selector. Add a sidebar widget: recent activity list (5 items with icon, text, time). Use a card style. Ensure the layout doesn't break on smaller screens. Add a collapsible sidebar for mobile.

### Task 5
Polish the dashboard: stats, table, chart placeholder, activity widget. Add a notifications dropdown in the header. Add breadcrumbs. Implement dark mode (dark: variants) with toggle. Add loading skeleton placeholders (pulse animation). Ensure focus states for keyboard navigation. Add a "Compact" view toggle that reduces padding. Document the component structure. Ensure color contrast and accessibility.
