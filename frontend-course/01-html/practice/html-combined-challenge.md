# Practice: Combined HTML Challenge

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a recipe page: title, description, ingredients list (ul), steps (ol), prep time, cook time (use time or data attributes), and an image. Use figure/figcaption for the image. Add semantic structure.

### Task 2
Build an event listing page: three events with name, date, location, description, and "Register" link. Use article for each event. Include a filter form (by date, by category) with select and submit. Structure only.

### Task 3
Create a pricing page: three tiers in a comparison table. Include features (checkmarks/crosses), price, and CTA button. Use thead, tbody, th with scope. Add a FAQ section below with dl. Ensure mobile-friendly table structure (consider using a card layout structure as alternative).

### Task 4
Build a team page: header, intro, and a grid of team member cards. Each card: photo, name, role, short bio, social links. Use figure, figcaption, and semantic grouping. Add an "Contact us" CTA and contact form at the bottom.

### Task 5
Create a complete portfolio/homepage: hero section, about, services (three cards), portfolio grid (3–4 items with image, title, link), testimonials (blockquote), contact form, and footer. Use full semantic structure, meta tags, Open Graph, skip link, and proper heading hierarchy. Ensure all images have alt, all links have proper rel where needed, and forms are fully accessible. This should be a production-ready HTML structure.
