# Practice: Semantic Structure

## Tasks

### Task 1
Convert a div-based layout to semantic HTML: replace divs with header, main, nav, footer. Ensure one main, one nav, and proper nesting. Add an h1 inside main.

### Task 2
Create a product card using semantic elements: figure for the image, figcaption for the caption, article or section for the card container. Include product name (h2), price, and a short description.

### Task 3
Build a news article page: header (site nav), main (article with header, sections, footer), aside (related articles), and page footer. Use article, section, and aside correctly. Add proper heading hierarchy.

### Task 4
Create a dashboard layout structure (HTML only): header with logo and user menu, sidebar nav (links), main content area with multiple sections (e.g., "Overview", "Recent Activity", "Quick Stats"). Use nav, main, section. Add aria-labels where helpful.

### Task 5
Build a full landing page structure: hero (header + h1 + CTA), features section (three feature blocks with h2, p), testimonials (blockquote with cite), pricing table, CTA section, and footer. Use only semantic elements. Ensure logical document outline. Add a skip link and proper landmarks.
