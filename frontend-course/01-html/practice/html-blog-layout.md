# Practice: Blog Layout (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a blog index page structure: header with site name and nav (Home, Blog, About), main content area, and footer. Use semantic elements. Add an h1 for the blog title.

### Task 2
Add a list of three blog post previews. Each preview: title (h2), date, excerpt (paragraph), and "Read more" link. Wrap each in an article element. Use time element with datetime for dates.

### Task 3
Create a single blog post template: article with header (title, author, date), main content (multiple paragraphs, one blockquote, one code block with pre/code), and footer (tags list, share links). Use proper heading hierarchy.

### Task 4
Build a blog layout with sidebar: main column (article list or single post) and aside (author bio, recent posts list, categories). Use semantic structure. Add a search form in the sidebar (search input, submit button).

### Task 5
Complete the blog: add pagination structure (prev/next links, page numbers), related posts section, comment form structure (name, email, comment textarea, submit), and breadcrumbs. Ensure full accessibility (aria-labels, skip link). Add meta for a sample post (title, description, og:tags for sharing).
