# Practice: Contact Form Page (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a contact page with: page title (h1), short intro paragraph, and a basic form (name, email, message). Use proper labels, required attributes, and appropriate input types. Add a submit button.

### Task 2
Expand the form: add subject (select: General, Support, Sales, Other), phone (optional, type="tel"), and a checkbox for "Subscribe to newsletter." Use fieldset and legend for the checkbox group. Add placeholder and aria-describedby where helpful.

### Task 3
Add client-side validation: required fields, email format, minlength for message (e.g., 10 chars). Use pattern attribute for phone if desired. Add a clear error message area (aria-live) structure. Use title on pattern for user feedback.

### Task 4
Create a full contact page: header with nav, main content (intro + form), sidebar or section with contact info (address, phone, email, business hours). Add a map embed placeholder (iframe with title). Use a two-column layout structure with semantic HTML only.

### Task 5
Polish the contact page: add success/error message regions (aria-live="polite"), ensure all form fields have proper labels and descriptions, add a "Clear form" button (type="reset"), and include a privacy notice near the submit button. Add meta tags and ensure the form has proper action and method. Include a reCAPTCHA or honeypot field structure for spam prevention (HTML structure only).
