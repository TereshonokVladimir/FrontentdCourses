# Practice: Lists and Tables

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create an unordered list of five programming languages. Nest a second list under one item (e.g., "JavaScript" with sub-items: "React", "Vue", "Angular").

### Task 2
Create an ordered list of steps for "How to make coffee." Use start and reversed attributes on a separate ordered list to show a countdown (5, 4, 3, 2, 1).

### Task 3
Build a description list for a glossary: define HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API. Use dt for terms and dd for definitions. Add a second dd to one term for an alternative definition.

### Task 4
Create a table for a product comparison: three products, five features. Use thead, tbody, th with scope, and caption. Include a "Notes" row that spans all columns with colspan.

### Task 5
Build a complex table: sales report with months as columns, regions as rows, and a totals row/column. Use thead, tfoot, tbody. Add proper scope on all th elements. Include a summary in the caption.
