# Practice: Links and Navigation

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a page with five links: one to an external site (with rel="noopener noreferrer" and target="_blank"), one to another page, one to a section on the same page, one mailto link, and one tel link.

### Task 2
Build a simple navigation bar with four links (Home, About, Services, Contact). Wrap in a nav element with aria-label. Add a logo link at the start.

### Task 3
Create a breadcrumb navigation: Home > Products > Category > Product Name. Use a nav with aria-label="Breadcrumb". Make each segment a link except the current page.

### Task 4
Build a footer with: copyright, three column links (Company, Support, Legal), and social media links. Use rel="noopener noreferrer" on external links. Add a "Back to top" anchor link.

### Task 5
Create a multi-level navigation: main nav with dropdown sections. Use nested lists. Ensure all links are keyboard accessible. Add aria-expanded and aria-haspopup where appropriate for a dropdown structure (structure only—no JS).
