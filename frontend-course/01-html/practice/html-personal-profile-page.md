# Practice: Personal Profile Page (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create the basic structure: header with your name as h1, a short bio paragraph, and a footer with copyright. Use semantic elements (header, main, footer). Add a profile image with alt text.

### Task 2
Add a navigation section with links: About, Skills, Experience, Contact. Create anchor targets for each section. Add a skills list (unordered) with at least five items. Use strong for key skills.

### Task 3
Add an experience section with two or three job/education entries. Use a definition list or a structured div with headings and paragraphs. Include dates, role, and description for each.

### Task 4
Add a contact section with: email (mailto link), phone (tel link), and links to LinkedIn and GitHub (external, with rel="noopener noreferrer"). Add a simple contact form: name, email, message textarea, submit button. Use proper labels and required attributes.

### Task 5
Polish the profile page: add meta tags (title, description), Open Graph for sharing, and a favicon link. Ensure full semantic structure (main, article/section for each part). Add a "Download Resume" link. Verify heading hierarchy (one h1, logical h2/h3). Add skip link for accessibility. Include a projects section with 2–3 project cards (title, short description, link).
