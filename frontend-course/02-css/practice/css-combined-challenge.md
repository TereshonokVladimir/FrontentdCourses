# Practice: Combined CSS Challenge

## Tasks

### Task 1
Build a pricing section: 3 pricing cards with a "featured" middle card (larger, accent border). Use CSS Grid. Add a toggle for monthly/yearly (structure only—no JS). Style the featured card with `transform: scale(1.05)` and extra shadow. Ensure responsive: 1 column on mobile.

### Task 2
Create a testimonial carousel structure: 3 testimonials in a horizontal scroll container. Use `overflow-x: auto` and `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` on the container. Each testimonial has `scroll-snap-align: center`. Add scrollbar styling or hide it. Include prev/next buttons (structure only).

### Task 3
Build a footer: 4 columns of links on desktop, 2x2 grid on tablet, stacked on mobile. Use flexbox or grid. Add a newsletter signup form at the top. Include social icons (placeholder). Add a bottom bar with copyright and legal links. Use CSS variables for colors.

### Task 4
Create a product detail layout: image gallery (main image + thumbnails) on the left, details on the right. On mobile, stack. Use grid. Add a sticky "Add to cart" bar that appears on scroll (mobile). Style the thumbnails with active state (border or scale).

### Task 5
Build a complete multi-page site styling: consistent header, footer, and content area. Use a shared CSS file with variables. Include a blog list page (cards) and a single post page (article layout with max-width for readability). Add a 404 page style. Ensure all pages share the same design language. Add print styles: hide nav, simplify colors, ensure readability. Document the structure in comments.
