# Practice: Card Component System (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a basic card: white background, border-radius, padding, and subtle box-shadow. Include an image area (placeholder), title (h3), description (p), and a button. Use flexbox to stack content. Set max-width on the card.

### Task 2
Build a card grid: 3 cards per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile. Use CSS Grid with gap. Ensure cards have equal height (use `align-items: stretch` or `grid-auto-rows: 1fr`). Add hover effect: slight lift (transform) and shadow increase.

### Task 3
Create card variants using CSS custom properties or modifier classes: default, featured (larger, accent border), and compact (less padding, smaller text). Use BEM or data attributes. Ensure variants share base styles.

### Task 4
Add a card with image on top, and a horizontal variant (image on left, content on right). Use `object-fit: cover` on images. Make the horizontal card stack on mobile. Add optional badge (e.g., "New") positioned in the top-right corner of the card.

### Task 5
Build a complete card system: base card, 3 variants, responsive grid, hover/focus states, and dark mode support. Use CSS variables for all colors and spacing. Document the component (comments) with usage examples. Add a card with overlay (content on top of image) variant. Ensure focus styles for interactive cards (links/buttons).
