# Practice: Navigation Bar (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a horizontal navigation bar: logo on the left, 4 links on the right. Use flexbox with `justify-content: space-between`. Add padding, background, and a bottom border. Style links with hover state (underline or color change).

### Task 2
Make the nav responsive: on mobile (< 768px), stack logo and links vertically. Use a hamburger icon (three lines) that toggles visibility. Implement with CSS only (checkbox hack: checkbox controls display of nav links). Animate the hamburger to X when open.

### Task 3
Add a dropdown to one nav item: "Products" with sub-items (Product A, B, C). Use `:hover` to show dropdown on desktop. Position dropdown with `position: absolute`. Add a slight delay before hide for better UX. Style dropdown with shadow and border-radius.

### Task 4
Create a sticky navigation: nav sticks to top on scroll. Add a subtle shadow when scrolled. Ensure dropdown doesn't get cut off (check overflow on parent). Add focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation. Ensure sufficient contrast.

### Task 5
Build a full nav system: desktop (horizontal with dropdown), mobile (hamburger with full-screen overlay menu), and tablet (adapted layout). Add active state for current page. Include a search bar that expands on focus (desktop). Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible. Add `prefers-reduced-motion` support for animations.
