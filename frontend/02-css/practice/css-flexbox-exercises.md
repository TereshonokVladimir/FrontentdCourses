# Practice: Flexbox Exercises

## Tasks

### Task 1
Center a div both horizontally and vertically inside its parent using flexbox. The parent should fill the viewport (min-height: 100vh). Use `justify-content` and `align-items`.

### Task 2
Create a navbar: logo on the left, 3 links in the center, and a button on the right. Use flexbox. Make the center links evenly spaced. Add gap between items. Ensure the navbar doesn't wrap on medium screens.

### Task 3
Build a card layout: 3 cards in a row with equal width. Each card should grow to fill space (`flex: 1`). Add `flex-wrap` so on narrow screens they stack. Use gap for spacing. One card should be twice as wide (`flex: 2`).

### Task 4
Create a sticky footer layout: header (fixed height), main content (flex: 1 to fill space), footer (fixed height). Use flexbox on the body with `min-height: 100vh` and `flex-direction: column`. The main should push the footer down.

### Task 5
Build a responsive image gallery: 4 images per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile. Use flexbox with `flex-wrap`. Images should maintain aspect ratio (`object-fit: cover`). Add a gap. On hover, scale one image slightly (transform) and add overlay. Use `flex: 1 1 200px` for flexible sizing.
