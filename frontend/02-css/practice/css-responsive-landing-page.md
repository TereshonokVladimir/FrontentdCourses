# Practice: Responsive Landing Page (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a simple landing page structure (HTML + CSS): hero section with h1, subtitle, and CTA button. Use flexbox to center content. Set max-width on the container and center it. Use rem for spacing and typography.

### Task 2
Add a features section: three feature cards in a row on desktop, stacked on mobile. Use CSS Grid with `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))`. Add a media query for mobile (single column). Include icon placeholder, title, and description in each card.

### Task 3
Build a full landing page: header with logo and nav, hero, features (3 cards), testimonials (2 quotes), CTA section, and footer. Make the header sticky. Use CSS variables for colors and spacing. Ensure proper heading hierarchy.

### Task 4
Add responsiveness: mobile-first approach. Breakpoints at 768px and 1024px. Hamburger menu structure for mobile (CSS-only toggle with checkbox hack or show/hide). Footer with multiple columns on desktop, stacked on mobile. Ensure touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px).

### Task 5
Polish the landing page: add smooth scroll, focus-visible styles for accessibility, prefers-reduced-motion support, and dark mode via prefers-color-scheme. Use CSS custom properties for theming. Add subtle hover/focus transitions. Ensure contrast meets WCAG AA. Include a "Back to top" button that appears on scroll.
