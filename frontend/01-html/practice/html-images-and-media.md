# Practice: Images and Media

## Tasks

### Task 1
Add three images to a page: one informative (with descriptive alt), one decorative (alt=""), and one that might fail to load (use a broken URL to test fallback). Set width and height on the informative image.

### Task 2
Create a responsive image setup using the picture element. Provide WebP and JPEG sources. Include a fallback img with alt text. Use different srcsets for mobile and desktop if needed.

### Task 3
Embed a video with controls, poster, and two source formats (WebM and MP4). Add a track element for captions (create a minimal .vtt file or placeholder). Include fallback text for unsupported browsers.

### Task 4
Create an audio player with controls. Provide OGG and MP3 sources. Add a fallback message. Include a download link as additional fallback.

### Task 5
Build an image gallery structure: a main featured image and a row of thumbnails below. Use figure and figcaption for the main image. Ensure all images have appropriate alt text. Add loading="lazy" to thumbnails.
