# Practice: Headings and Text

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a page with one h1, two h2 sections, and two h3 subsections under the second h2. Add a short paragraph under each heading. Ensure logical hierarchy.

### Task 2
Build a simple article structure: title (h1), intro paragraph, three sections with h2 headings, each with 2–3 paragraphs. Use strong and em for key terms in one paragraph.

### Task 3
Create a FAQ page. Use an h1 for the page title, then a description list (dl) with dt for questions and dd for answers. Add a short intro paragraph before the list.

### Task 4
Build a documentation page with: main title, table of contents (anchor links to sections), and four sections with h2 and content. Use mark to highlight important terms in one section.

### Task 5
Create a long-form article (800+ words placeholder) with proper heading hierarchy: h1, multiple h2, h3 where needed. Include blockquote, pre for code snippet, and appropriate inline formatting (strong, em, mark). Add a "Last updated" date in the footer of the article.
