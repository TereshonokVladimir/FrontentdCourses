# Practice: Validation and SEO

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a form with HTML5 validation: required, type="email", minlength, maxlength, pattern (e.g., username: letters and numbers only). Add title to pattern for error message. Test that invalid submission is blocked.

### Task 2
Add full meta tags to an existing page: title (unique), description, canonical, robots. Add Open Graph: og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url. Include Twitter card meta.

### Task 3
Fix validation errors in a provided HTML snippet (create the snippet first): unclosed tags, duplicate ids, missing alt, invalid nesting. Document each fix.

### Task 4
Create a multi-page site structure (3 pages): ensure each page has unique title and description, correct canonical, and consistent nav. Add structured data placeholder (JSON-LD script tag with comment explaining what would go there).

### Task 5
Build an SEO-optimized article page: proper heading hierarchy, meta title/description, Open Graph, schema.org Article structure (in a script type="application/ld+json"), internal links to related content, and semantic structure. Add a table of contents with anchor links. Ensure images have descriptive alt.
