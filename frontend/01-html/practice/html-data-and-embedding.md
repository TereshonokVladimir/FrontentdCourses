# Practice: Data Attributes and Embedding

## Tasks

### Task 1
Add data attributes to a list of items: data-id, data-category, data-price. Create a product list where each item has these attributes. Show how you would access them in JavaScript (in a comment).

### Task 2
Create an iframe that embeds an external page (e.g., a map or video). Add sandbox with minimal permissions, title for accessibility, and loading="lazy". Use appropriate allow attributes if needed.

### Task 3
Build a tab structure using data attributes: data-tab and data-tab-panel. Create three tabs and three panels. Add aria attributes (role="tablist", role="tab", role="tabpanel", aria-selected, aria-controls). Structure only—no JS.

### Task 4
Create a component that uses data-* for configuration: a card with data-theme="light|dark", data-layout="horizontal|vertical". Add multiple card instances with different data values. Document the expected behavior in comments.

### Task 5
Build a page that embeds: an iframe (with sandbox), a picture element (responsive images), and an inline SVG icon. Ensure the iframe has proper security attributes. Add a fallback for the picture. Use the SVG as a decorative icon with appropriate aria-hidden or role="img" with aria-label.
