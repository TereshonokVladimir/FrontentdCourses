# Practice: Forms Basics

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a simple login form: email input, password input, and submit button. Add labels with for/id, use required on both fields, and set appropriate input types. Use a form with action and method.

### Task 2
Build a registration form: username, email, password, confirm password, and a checkbox for terms. Use appropriate types, required, minlength on password. Add a reset button. Group related fields in a fieldset with legend.

### Task 3
Create a survey form with: name (text), age (number with min/max), country (select), favorite color (radio), interests (checkboxes), and comments (textarea). Use fieldset and legend for each group. Add proper labels and names.

### Task 4
Build a file upload form: profile picture (accept image/*), resume (accept .pdf,.doc), and an optional attachments field (multiple files). Add helper text with aria-describedby. Include a submit button with clear labeling.

### Task 5
Create a multi-step form structure (HTML only): Step 1 (personal info), Step 2 (address), Step 3 (payment). Use fieldset for each step with a legend. Add progress indication (e.g., "Step 2 of 3"). Include next/back buttons (type="button" for now) and a final submit.
