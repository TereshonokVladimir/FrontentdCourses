# Practice: Forms and Inputs

## Tasks

### Task 1
Style a login form: email and password inputs, submit button. Use consistent padding, border, rounded. Add focus ring. Style the button with hover. Use flex or grid for layout. Add a "Remember me" checkbox. Style the checkbox (or use a custom styled one). No semicolons.

### Task 2
Build a registration form: name, email, password, confirm password. Add validation error display (red border, error text). Style each field consistently. Add a select dropdown and style it. Use the same design language. Group related fields (e.g., password + confirm). Add a submit button with loading state (disabled + spinner or "Loading...").

### Task 3
Create a multi-step form indicator: steps 1, 2, 3 with connecting line. Current step highlighted. Completed steps have checkmark. Use flex. Make it responsive (horizontal on desktop, compact on mobile). Style the form sections for each step. Add Next/Back buttons. Show only current step's fields (or all with current visible).

### Task 4
Build a search input with filters: search bar with icon, filter dropdowns (category, date range). Use flex. Add a "Clear filters" button. Style the dropdowns to match. Add a tag/chip display for active filters with remove button. Ensure the layout works when many filters are active. Use a responsive layout (filters may wrap or collapse).

### Task 5
Create a comprehensive form: text, email, password, select, checkbox, radio, textarea. Style all consistently. Add a file upload area (drag-and-drop zone style). Add date picker placeholder (styled input). Implement error states for each. Add a "Save draft" and "Submit" button. Use @tailwindcss/forms if available for better defaults. Ensure focus order and keyboard navigation. Add aria attributes for accessibility. Document the form patterns.
