# Practice: Landing Page (Mini-Project)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create a hero section: full viewport height, centered content, background (gradient or image). Heading (text-4xl or larger), subheading, and CTA buttons (primary and secondary). Use flex for centering. Add padding. Ensure text is readable (contrast). No semicolons.

### Task 2
Add a features section: 3 feature cards in a grid. Each has icon (placeholder or emoji), title, description. Use responsive grid (1 col mobile, 3 desktop). Add section heading above. Use consistent spacing (gap, padding). Add subtle background or border to differentiate from hero.

### Task 3
Build a testimonials section: 2–3 testimonials in a carousel-like layout or grid. Each: quote, author name, role/company. Use a card style. Add a background (gray-50 or similar). Consider a decorative element (quotes, border). Ensure responsive.

### Task 4
Add a pricing section: 3 pricing tiers. Each tier: name, price, features list, CTA button. Highlight the middle tier (border, shadow, or scale). Use a grid. Add "Popular" badge to the highlighted tier. Style the buttons: filled for CTA, outline for others. Ensure the layout works on mobile (stack or scroll).

### Task 5
Complete the landing page: hero, features, testimonials, pricing, and footer. Add a navbar at top (sticky) with logo and links that scroll to sections. Add a footer with links, social icons, and copyright. Implement smooth scroll for anchor links. Add dark mode support (dark: variants) with a toggle. Ensure full responsive design. Add hover/focus states throughout. Run Lighthouse and fix any issues. Document the design decisions.
